A very simple script to open a bunch of google and pastebin dorks at once. Run it against a domain and it'll google dork for possibly sensitive files.

```git clone https://github.com/DanMcInerney/fast-recon```

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

```python fast-recon.py -d "danmcinerney.org"```

Do not include http:// or https:// in the domain name.
